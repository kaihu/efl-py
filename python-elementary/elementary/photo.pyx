    """An Elementary photo widget is intended for displaying a photo, for
    ex., a person's image (contact).

    Simple, yet with a very specific purpose. It has a decorative frame
    around the inner image itself, on the default theme.

    This widget relies on an internal :py:class:`Icon`, so that the APIs of these two
    widgets are similar (drag and drop is also possible here, for example).

    Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
        - ``"clicked"`` - This is called when a user has clicked the photo
        - ``"drag,start"`` - One has started dragging the inner image out of the
                            photo's frame
        - ``"drag,end"`` - One has dropped the dragged image somewhere
