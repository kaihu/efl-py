    The progress bar is a widget for visually representing the progress
    status of a given job/task.

    A progress bar may be horizontal or vertical. It may display an icon
    besides it, as well as primary and **units** labels. The former is meant
    to label the widget as a whole, while the latter, which is formatted
    with floating point values (and thus accepts a ``printf``-style format
    string, like ``"%1.2f units"``), is meant to label the widget's B{progress
    value}. Label, icon and unit strings/objects are **optional** for
    progress bars.

    A progress bar may be **inverted**, in which case it gets its values
    inverted, i.e., high values being on the left or top and low values on
    the right or bottom, for horizontal and vertical modes respectively.

    The **span** of the progress, as set by :py:attr:`span_size`, is its length
    (horizontally or vertically), unless one puts size hints on the widget
    to expand on desired directions, by any container. That length will be
    scaled by the object or applications scaling factor. Applications can
    query the progress bar for its value with :py:attr:`value`.

    This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
    :py:class:`elementary.layout.Layout`:

        - C{"changed"} - when the value is changed

    This widget has the following styles:

        - ``"default"``
        - ``"wheel"`` (simple style, no text, no progression, only "pulse"
            effect is available)

    Default text parts of the progressbar widget that you can use for are:

        - "default" - Label of the progressbar

    Default content parts of the progressbar widget that you can use for are:

        - "icon" - An icon of the progressbar

        progress bar widget to a "pulsing state", to give the user an idea
        that some computation is being held, but without exact progress
        values. In the default theme, it will animate its bar with the
        contents filling in constantly and back to non-filled, in a loop. To

        pulse(True) or pulse(False).
