cdef class Fileselector(LayoutClass):

    """

    A file selector is a widget that allows a user to navigate through a
    file system, reporting file selections back via its API.

    It contains shortcut buttons for home directory (*~*) and to jump one
    directory upwards (..), as well as cancel/ok buttons to confirm/cancel a
    given selection. After either one of those two former actions, the file
    selector will issue its ``"done"`` smart callback.

    There's a text entry on it, too, showing the name of the current
    selection. There's the possibility of making it editable, so it is
    useful on file saving dialogs on applications, where one gives a file
    name to save contents to, in a given directory in the system. This
    custom file name will be reported on the ``"done"`` smart callback
    (explained in sequence).

    Finally, it has a view to display file system items into in two possible
    forms:

    - list
    - grid

    If Elementary is built with support of the Ethumb thumbnailing library,
    the second form of view will display preview thumbnails of files which
    it supports.

    This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
    :py:class:`elementary.layout.Layout`:

    - ``"selected"`` - the user has clicked on a file (when not in
        folders-only mode) or directory (when in folders-only mode)
    - ``"directory,open"`` - the list has been populated with new
      content (*event_info* is the directory's path)
    - ``"done"`` - the user has clicked on the "ok" or "cancel"
      buttons (*event_info* is the selection's path)
