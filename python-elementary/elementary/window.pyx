.. rubric:: Window types

.. data:: ELM_WIN_BASIC

    A normal window.

    Indicates a normal, top-level window. Almost every window will be
    created with this type.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_DIALOG_BASIC

    Used for simple dialog windows

.. data:: ELM_WIN_DESKTOP

    For special desktop windows, like a background window holding desktop icons.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_DOCK

    The window is used as a dock or panel.

    Usually would be kept on top of any other window by the Window Manager.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_TOOLBAR

    The window is used to hold a floating toolbar, or similar.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_MENU

    Similar to ELM_WIN_TOOLBAR.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_UTILITY

    A persistent utility window, like a toolbox or palette.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_SPLASH

    Splash window for a starting up application.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_DROPDOWN_MENU

    The window is a dropdown menu, as when an entry in a menubar is clicked.

    Typically used with elm_win_override_set(). This hint exists for
    completion only, as the EFL way of implementing a menu would not
    normally use a separate window for its contents.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_POPUP_MENU

    Like ELM_WIN_DROPDOWN_MENU, but for the menu triggered by right-clicking
    an object.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_TOOLTIP

    The window is a tooltip.

    A short piece of explanatory text that typically appear after the mouse
    cursor hovers over an object for a while. Typically used with
    elm_win_override_set() and also not very commonly used in the EFL.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_NOTIFICATION

    A notification window, like a warning about battery life or a new E-Mail
    received.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_COMBO

    A window holding the contents of a combo box.

    Not usually used in the EFL.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_DND

    Used to indicate the window is a representation of an object being
    dragged across different windows, or even applications.

    Typically used with elm_win_override_set().

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INLINED_IMAGE

    The window is rendered onto an image buffer.

    No actual window is created for this type, instead the window and all of
    its contents will be rendered to an image buffer. This allows to have
    children window inside a parent one just like any other object would be,
    and do other things like applying Evas_Map effects to it. This is the
    only type of window that requires the parent parameter of elm_win_add()
    to be a valid Evas_Object.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_SOCKET_IMAGE

    The window is rendered onto an image buffer and can be shown other
    process's plug image object.

    No actual window is created for this type, instead the window and all of
    its contents will be rendered to an image buffer and can be shown other
    process's plug image object


.. rubric:: Indicator states

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_UNKNOWN

    Unknown indicator state.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_HIDE

    Hides the indicator.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_SHOW

    Shows the indicator.


.. rubric:: Indicator opacity

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_OPACITY_UNKNOWN

    Unknown indicator opacity mode.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_OPAQUE

    Opacifies the indicator.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_TRANSLUCENT

    Be translucent the indicator.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_INDICATOR_TRANSPARENT

    Transparentizes the indicator.


.. rubric:: Keyboard virtual keyboard modes

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_UNKNOWN

    Unknown keyboard state.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_OFF

    Request to deactivate the keyboard.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_ON

    Enable keyboard with default layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_ALPHA

    Alpha (a-z) keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_NUMERIC

    Numeric keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_PIN

    PIN keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_PHONE_NUMBER

    Phone keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_HEX

    Hexadecimal numeric keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_TERMINAL

    Full (QWERTY) keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_PASSWORD

    Password keyboard layout.

.. data:: ELM_WIN_KEYBOARD_IP

    The window class of Elementary.

    Contains functions to manipulate windows. The Evas engine used to render
    the window contents is specified in the system or user elementary config
    files (whichever is found last), and can be overridden with the
    ELM_ENGINE environment variable for testing.  Engines that may be
    supported (depending on Evas and Ecore-Evas compilation setup and
    modules actually installed at runtime) are (listed in order of best
    supported and most likely to be complete and work to lowest quality).

    - "x11", "x", "software-x11", "software_x11" (Software rendering in
        X11)
    - "gl", "opengl", "opengl-x11", "opengl_x11" (OpenGL or OpenGL-ES2
        rendering in X11)
    - "shot:..." (Virtual screenshot renderer - renders to output file
        and exits)
    - "fb", "software-fb", "software_fb" (Linux framebuffer direct
        software rendering)
    - "sdl", "software-sdl", "software_sdl" (SDL software rendering to
        SDL buffer)
    - "gl-sdl", "gl_sdl", "opengl-sdl", "opengl_sdl" (OpenGL or
        OpenGL-ES2 rendering using SDL as the buffer)
    - "gdi", "software-gdi", "software_gdi" (Windows WIN32 rendering via
        GDI with software)
    - "dfb", "directfb" (Rendering to a DirectFB window)
    - "x11-8", "x8", "software-8-x11", "software_8_x11" (Rendering in
        grayscale using dedicated 8bit software engine in X11)
    - "x11-16", "x16", "software-16-x11", "software_16_x11" (Rendering in
        X11 using 16bit software engine)
    - "wince-gdi", "software-16-wince-gdi", "software_16_wince_gdi"
        (Windows CE rendering via GDI with 16bit software renderer)
    - "sdl-16", "software-16-sdl", "software_16_sdl" (Rendering to SDL
        buffer with 16bit software renderer)
    - "ews" (rendering to EWS - Ecore + Evas Single Process Windowing
        System)
    - "gl-cocoa", "gl_cocoa", "opengl-cocoa", "opengl_cocoa" (OpenGL
        rendering in Cocoa)
    - "psl1ght" (PS3 rendering using PSL1GHT)

    All engines use a simple string to select the engine to render, EXCEPT
    the "shot" engine. This actually encodes the output of the virtual
    screenshot and how long to delay in the engine string. The engine string
    is encoded in the following way::

        "shot:[delay=XX][:][repeat=DDD][:][file=XX]"

    Where options are separated by a ":" char if more than one option is
    given, with delay, if provided being the first option and file the last
    (order is important). The delay specifies how long to wait after the
    window is shown before doing the virtual "in memory" rendering and then
    save the output to the file specified by the file option (and then exit).
    If no delay is given, the default is 0.5 seconds. If no file is given the
    default output file is "out.png". Repeat option is for continuous
    capturing screenshots. Repeat range is from 1 to 999 and filename is
    fixed to "out001.png" Some examples of using the shot engine::

        ELM_ENGINE="shot:delay=1.0:repeat=5:file=elm_test.png" elementary_test
        ELM_ENGINE="shot:delay=1.0:file=elm_test.png" elementary_test
        ELM_ENGINE="shot:file=elm_test2.png" elementary_test
        ELM_ENGINE="shot:delay=2.0" elementary_test
        ELM_ENGINE="shot:" elementary_test

    Signals that you can add callbacks for are:

    - "delete,request": the user requested to close the window. See
        :py:attr:`autodel`.
    - "focus,in": window got focus
    - "focus,out": window lost focus
    - "moved": window that holds the canvas was moved
    - "withdrawn": window is still managed normally but removed from view
    - "iconified": window is minimized (perhaps into an icon or taskbar)
    - "normal": window is in a normal state (not withdrawn or iconified)
    - "stick": window has become sticky (shows on all desktops)
    - "unstick": window has stopped being sticky
    - "fullscreen": window has become fullscreen
    - "unfullscreen": window has stopped being fullscreen
    - "maximized": window has been maximized

        Add ``subobj`` as a resize object of the window.

        Setting an object as a resize object of the window means that the
        ``subobj`` child's size and position will be controlled by the window
        directly. That is, the object will be resized to match the window size
        and should never be moved or resized manually by the developer.

        In addition, resize objects of the window control what the minimum size
        of it will be, as well as whether it can or not be resized by the user.

        For the end user to be able to resize a window by dragging the handles
        or borders provided by the Window Manager, or using any other similar
        mechanism, all of the resize objects in the window should have their
        :py:attr:`size_hint_weight` set to EVAS_HINT_EXPAND.

        Also notice that the window can get resized to the current size of the
        object if the EVAS_HINT_EXPAND is set **after** the call to
        resize_object_add(). So if the object should get resized to the
        size of the window, set this hint **before** adding it as a resize object
