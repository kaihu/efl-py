cdef class Radio(LayoutClass):

    """

    Radio is a widget that allows for one or more options to be displayed
    and have the user choose only one of them.

    A radio object contains an indicator, an optional Label and an optional
    icon object. While it's possible to have a group of only one radio they,
    are normally used in groups of two or more.

    Radio objects are grouped in a slightly different, compared to other UI
    toolkits. There is no seperate group name/id to remember or manage. The
    members represent the group, there are the group. To make a group, use
    :py:func:`group_add()` and pass existing radio object and the new radio
    object.

    The radio object(s) will select from one of a set of integer values, so
    any value they are configuring needs to be mapped to a set of integers.
    To configure what value that radio object represents, use
    elm_radio_state_value_set() to set the integer it represents. The
    value of the whole group (which one is currently selected) is
    represented by the property :py:attr:`value` on any group member. For
    convenience the radio objects are also able to directly set an
    integer(int) to the value that is selected. To specify the pointer to
    this integer to modify, use :py:attr:`value_pointer`. The radio objects
    will modify this directly. That implies the pointer must point to valid
    memory for as long as the radio objects exist.

    This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
    :py:class:`elementary.layout_class.LayoutClass`:

    - changed - This is called whenever the user changes the state of one of
        the radio objects within the group of radio objects that work together.

    Default text parts of the radio widget that you can use for are:

    - "default" - Label of the radio

    Default content parts of the radio widget that you can use for are:

    - "icon" - An icon of the radio
