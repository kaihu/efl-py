cdef class FileselectorButton(Button):

    """This is a button that, when clicked, creates an Elementary window (or
    inner window) with a :py:class:`elementary.fileselector.Fileselector`
    within.

    When a file is chosen, the (inner) window is closed and the button emits
    a signal having the selected file as it's ``event_info``.

    This widget encapsulates operations on its internal file selector on its
    own API. There is less control over its file selector than that one
    would have instantiating one directly.

    The following styles are available for this button:
        - ``"default"``
        - ``"anchor"``
        - ``"hoversel_vertical"``
        - ``"hoversel_vertical_entry"``

    This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
    :py:class:`elementary.button.Button`:
        - ``"file,chosen"`` - the user has selected a path which comes as the
          ``event_info`` data

    Default text parts of the fileselector_button widget that you can use for
    are:
        - "default" - Label of the fileselector_button

    Default content parts of the fileselector_button widget that you can use for
    are:
        - "icon" - Icon of the fileselector_button
