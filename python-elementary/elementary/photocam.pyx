cdef class Photocam(Object):

    """

    This is a widget specifically for displaying high-resolution digital
    camera photos giving speedy feedback (fast load), low memory footprint
    and zooming and panning as well as fitting logic. It is entirely focused
    on jpeg images, and takes advantage of properties of the jpeg format (via
    evas loader features in the jpeg loader).

    Signals that you can add callbacks for are:

    - "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the photo without
        dragging around.
    - "press" - This is called when a user has pressed down on the photo.
    - "longpressed" - This is called when a user has pressed down on the
        photo for a long time without dragging around.
    - "clicked,double" - This is called when a user has double-clicked the
        photo.
    - "load" - Photo load begins.
    - "loaded" - This is called when the image file load is complete for
        the first view (low resolution blurry version).
    - "load,detail" - Photo detailed data load begins.
    - "loaded,detail" - This is called when the image file load is
        complete for the detailed image data (full resolution needed).
    - "zoom,start" - Zoom animation started.
    - "zoom,stop" - Zoom animation stopped.
    - "zoom,change" - Zoom changed when using an auto zoom mode.
    - "scroll" - the content has been scrolled (moved)
    - "scroll,anim,start" - scrolling animation has started
    - "scroll,anim,stop" - scrolling animation has stopped
    - "scroll,drag,start" - dragging the contents around has started
    - "scroll,drag,stop" - dragging the contents around has stopped
