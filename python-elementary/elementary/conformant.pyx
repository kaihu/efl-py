cdef class Conformant(LayoutClass):

    """

    The aim is to provide a widget that can be used in elementary apps to
    account for space taken up by the indicator, virtual keypad & softkey
    windows when running the illume2 module of E17.

    So conformant content will be sized and positioned considering the
    space required for such stuff, and when they popup, as a keyboard
    shows when an entry is selected, conformant content won't change.

    This widget emits the signals sent from :py:class:`elementary.layout.Layout`.

    Available styles for it:
        - ``"default"``

    Default content parts of the conformant widget that you can use for are:
        - "default" - A content of the conformant
