cdef class Scroller(Object):

    """A scroller holds a single object and "scrolls it around".

    This means that it allows the user to use a scrollbar (or a finger) to
    drag the viewable region around, allowing to move through a much larger
    object that is contained in the scroller. The scroller will always have
    a small minimum size by default as it won't be limited by the contents
    of the scroller.

    Signals that you can add callbacks for are:

    - "edge,left" - the left edge of the content has been reached
    - "edge,right" - the right edge of the content has been reached
    - "edge,top" - the top edge of the content has been reached
    - "edge,bottom" - the bottom edge of the content has been reached
    - "scroll" - the content has been scrolled (moved)
    - "scroll,anim,start" - scrolling animation has started
    - "scroll,anim,stop" - scrolling animation has stopped
    - "scroll,drag,start" - dragging the contents around has started
    - "scroll,drag,stop" - dragging the contents around has stopped

    Default content parts of the scroller widget that you can use for are:

    - "default" - A content of the scroller

    .. note:: The "scroll,anim,*" and "scroll,drag,*" signals are only emitted by
        user intervention.

    .. note:: When Elementary is in embedded mode the scrollbars will not be
        draggable, they appear merely as indicators of how much has been
        scrolled.

    .. note:: When Elementary is in desktop mode the thumbscroll(a.k.a.
        fingerscroll) won't work.
