    """

    Use the GestureLayer to detect gestures. The advantage is that you don't
    have to implement gesture detection, just set callbacks for gesture states.

    In order to use Gesture Layer you start with instantiating this class
    with a parent object parameter. Next 'activate' gesture layer with a
    :py:func:`attach()` call. Usually with same object as target (2nd
    parameter).

    Now you need to tell gesture layer what gestures you follow. This is
    done with :py:func:`cb_set()` call. By setting the callback you actually
    saying to gesture layer: I would like to know when the gesture
    ``Elm_Gesture_Type`` switches to state ``Elm_Gesture_State``.

    Next, you need to implement the actual action that follows the input in
    your callback.

    Note that if you like to stop being reported about a gesture, just set
    all callbacks referring this gesture to None. (again with
    :py:func:`cb_set()`)

    The information reported by gesture layer to your callback is depending
    on ``Elm_Gesture_Type``:

    - ``Elm_Gesture_Taps_Info`` is the info reported for tap gestures:

        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_TAPS``
        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_LONG_TAPS``
        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_DOUBLE_TAPS``
        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_TRIPLE_TAPS``

    - ``Elm_Gesture_Momentum_Info`` is info reported for momentum gestures:

        - ``ELM_GESTURE_MOMENTUM``

    - ``Elm_Gesture_Line_Info`` is the info reported for line gestures
      (this also contains ``Elm_Gesture_Momentum_Info`` internal structure):

        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_LINES``
        - ``ELM_GESTURE_N_FLICKS``

    Note that we consider a flick as a line-gesture that should be completed
    in flick-time-limit as defined in
    :py:class:`elementary.configuration.Configuration`.

    ``Elm_Gesture_Zoom_Info`` is the info reported for ``ELM_GESTURE_ZOOM``
    gesture.

    ``Elm_Gesture_Rotate_Info`` is the info reported for
    ``ELM_GESTURE_ROTATE`` gesture.

    Gesture Layer Tweaks:

    Note that line, flick, gestures can start without the need to remove
    fingers from surface. When user fingers rests on same-spot gesture is
    ended and starts again when fingers moved.

    Setting glayer_continues_enable to false in
    :py:class:`elementary.configuration.Configuration` will change this
    behavior so gesture starts when user touches (a *DOWN* event)
    touch-surface and ends when no fingers touches surface (a *UP* event).
